Youtube has a way of creating dynamic ad urls. This script was coded to run as a cron and find the latest used and block them to provide temporaly ad blocking tillt he url changes.

#!/bin/sh
BL=/var/www/html/bl.txt
mv $BL $BL.bak || echo "unable to move $BL to $BL.bak"
cat /var/log/pihole.log | grep -o ".*\.googlevideo\.com" | cut -d" " -f6 | sort -t r -k 2 -n | uniq > $BL
cat $BL $BL.bak | sort -t r -k 2 -n | uniq > $BL.temp
